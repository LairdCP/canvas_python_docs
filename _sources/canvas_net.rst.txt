*****************
Canvas Networking
*****************

The modules described in this chapter provide the interface to the
network stack in products with networking support (MG100, BL5340 DVK,
etc.).

The Canvas Software Suite products make use of standard MicroPython
network modules wherever possible. The Zephyr-based products (MG100,
Pinnacle 100, and BL5340 DVK) use the `network <https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/network.html>`_
module with a class named ``network.Zephyr``. An application can
bring up the network interface and wait for it to become available
using:

.. code-block:: python

    nic = network.Zephyr()
    nic.ifconfig("dhcp")
    while nic.isconnected() == False:
        time.sleep_ms(250)

The Canvas Software Suite also implements the
`socket <https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/socket.html>`_ and
`ssl <https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/ssl.html>`_ modules
for communication with remote hosts.

Custom network modules supported by the Canvas Software Suite are
documented below.
